					<ul><li><h5>Cycling: A sport, a hobby, good fun and the ideal type of transportation!</h5></li></ul>
					<br>
					-The bike, also known as "bicycle" is not just a UK hobby and outdoor sport. It is also a type of transportation that functions solely based on the energy expended by its user: the cyclist! To cycle is to be environmentally friendly, silent, economical, fast and healthy. Bikes and electric bikes have many advantages and more than a few fans.
					There have been balance bicycles, velocipedes, and penny-farthings. The bike has diverse origins, all of which materialised in the heart of the 19th century. Many shops opened in the UK, cycling slowly became more accessible and specialisations began to appear: you could become the owner of a mountain bike, a road bike, an electric bike, as well as a bike designed for urban use and there were even bike ranges specially made for your child...
					Bikes began to look like the models we know today at the end of the 19th century and their popularity rose at the beginning of the 20th, especially thanks to the Tour de France, launched in 1903. Since then, bikes have continued evolve. However, regardless of the discipline, they have always had something in common.
					<br>
					<br>
					-The main bike parts:
					<ul class="">
						<li>The frame</li>
						<li>The fork</li>
						<li>Two aligned wheels with tyres or tubular tyres</li>
						<li>The handlebar</li>
						<li>The drivetrain: chain, brakes, chainset, cables and housings</li>
						<li>Accessories (or components): saddle, seatpost, stem, pedals.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
					
						<ul><li><h5>Cycling: A constant evolution!</h5></li></ul>
					
					-Bikes work in a simple way but, from there on, they become hugely different when it comes to disciplines and equipment. Road Bike, Gravel bikes, cyclocross bikes, track bikes, full suspension mountain bikes or hardtail mountain bikes, for all-mountain, DH, and enduro, etc. BMX or the freestyle race bikes, fixies, tour and trekking bikes, city bikes, cargo and folding bikes, and even electric bikes... As you can see in our online shop, there are bikes for all types of uses and all types of people!
					UK points of sale are also becoming more diverse: you can find an MTB shop that specialises in MTB parts, shops especially for road bikes or hybrid models, and more. There is something for everyone!
					Today, bikes are designed so we can cycle everywhere in all kinds of conditions and so they meet the needs of every cyclist.
					<br>
					<br>
					-Do you want to cycle to work or are you more into leisurely rides or maybe even competitions? Speed or an enjoyable slower pace? Anyone can find bikes that work for them! Bikes for adults, bikes for women, kids bikes... There are even tandem bikes so you can discover the joys of cycling as a duo!
					The components and materials used have massively evolved for every type of bike over the last few years. Nowadays, frames are no longer necessarily made of steel. There are now more and more titanium, aluminium and carbon frames, according to the discipline and the brand ranges. Frames have become sturdier and more resistant, while remaining light and easy to handle.
					Forks, wheels, brakes and the handlebar have continuously changed over time. Each discipline has also evolved in its own right to improve the practice for its users (electronic groupsets for road bikes, mountain bike suspensions and disc brakes, and BMX rotors, etc.).
					<br>
